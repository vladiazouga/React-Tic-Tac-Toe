## Tic Tac Toe React App
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe app built with React. The app is made up of three components:

* Square: a child component that represents a square on the game board.
* Board: a parent component that represents the game board and handles the game logic.
* Game: the top-level component that handles the state of the game and renders the Board component.
### Dependencies
This code has dependencies on:

* React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* useState: a hook that allows functional components to have state.
### How to Use
To use this code, simply clone this repository and run the app using npm start. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

The game board will appear, and you can start playing Tic Tac Toe. Click on any of the empty squares to make a move. The game will alternate between X and O until someone wins, or the game ends in a tie.

The game also includes a list of moves that you can view by clicking on the "Game History" button. The game history will show you all the moves that have been played, and you can click on any move to jump to that point in the game.

### Credits
This code was adapted from a tutorial on the React website.
